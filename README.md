## For Case #4:
    + A pattern was designed that draws concentric squares in a defined area by height and width, these squares have a noise or deformity in the lines generated randomly, with a percentage of noise from lower to higher, respecting the area of each adjacent square.
    + Algorithm N stands for: The square quantity inside the given height and width.
    + f(n) is: f(n) = 10+532n+96nr
    + O(n) is: O(n )= n
    
### Get Started: How to run the program:
    Step 1: Compile and Run the mainPruebas.cpp (this will create 2 csv's with the given name on lines 40 and 41)
    Step 2: Once you have the Csv's, make sure you have Python, numpy and Matplotlib libraries installed.
    Step 3: Execute gui_ConcentrixSquares.py file on your terminal and take a look to the new pop-up window.
